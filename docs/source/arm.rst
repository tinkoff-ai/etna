Installation guide for Apple M1 (ARM)
=====================================

We are trying to make ETNA work with Apple M1 and other ARM chips.
However due to novelty of these architectures some packages ETNA depends on are going to run into some problems or bugs.

List of known problems:

- `CatBoost installation problem <https://github.com/catboost/catboost/issues/1526#issuecomment-978223384>`_
- `Numba (llvmlite) installation problem <https://github.com/numba/llvmlite/issues/693#issuecomment-909501195>`_
