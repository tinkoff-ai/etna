# Contribution guide

## How to start?

Contributing is quite easy: suggest ideas and make them done.
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/etna/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.

Every good PR usually consists of:
- feature implementation :)
- documentation to describe this feature to other people
- tests to ensure everything is implemented correctly
 

## Step-by-step guide

### Before the PR (NEED LINKS)
Please ensure that you have read the following docs:
- [documentation and FAQ]()
- [minimal examples section]()

### New feature

1. Make an issue with your feature description;
2. We shall discuss the design and its implementation details;
3. Once we agree that the plan looks good, go ahead and implement it.


### Bugfix

1. Goto [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/etna/issues);
2. Pick an issue and comment on the task that you want to work on this feature;
3. If you need more context on a specific issue, please ask, and we will discuss the details.

You can also join our [ETNA Support telegram chat](https://t.me/etna_support) to make it easier to discuss.
Once you finish implementing a feature or bugfix, please send a Pull Request.

### Documentation

etna uses [Numpydoc style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) for formatting docstrings.
Length of a line inside docstrings block must be limited to 100 characters to fit into Jupyter documentation popups.

You could check the docs with:
```bash
cd docs
make clean
make html
```

Now you could open them into your browser, for example with
```bash
open ./build/html/index.html
```

If you have some issues with building docs - please make sure that you installed the required packages.

```bash
poetry install -E docs
```
You also may need to install pandoc package ([pandoc installation guide](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)):
```bash
# Ubuntu
apt-get update && apt-get install -y pandoc

# Mac OS
brew install pandoc

#Windows
choco install pandoc
```



### Tests

Do not forget to check that your code passes the unit tests:
```bash
poetry install -E tests

pytest tests/ -v
```
And code style tests:
```bash
poetry install -E style

make format
```
